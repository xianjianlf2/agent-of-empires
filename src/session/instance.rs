/// ## Poller vocabulary (#2690 follow-up)
///
/// - **passive status**: a status transition detected by a background
///   poller from tmux pane state or ACP overlay, not by an explicit user
///   action.
/// - **passive status patch**: a minimal `PassiveStatusPatch` carrying
///   the `status` / `idle_entered_at` writes plus the monotone
///   `last_accessed_at` carry-through (user-gesture-only since #3465),
///   applied on disk via [`Instance::merge_passive_status_patch`].
/// - **live status baseline**: the last `Status` a caller has actually
///   observed live for an in-memory `Instance`. Held on
///   `Instance::live_status_baseline` (`#[serde(skip)]`). `None` means
///   no live observation exists yet, so
///   [`Instance::update_status_with_metadata`] seeds it on the first
///   call without restamping.
/// - **detected status**: the `Status` a poller reads from tmux / ACP /
///   sandbox liveness on a single call. Distinct from the disk-loaded
///   `Instance::status`, which can be stale by up to one tick.
/// - **poller-authoritative status**: for plain-tmux sessions, the poller
///   owns `Instance::status`. For structured/ACP sessions,
///   `apply_acp_overlay_inplace` is the authority; see its docstring.
