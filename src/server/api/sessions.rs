// so the file always covers every observed workspace; this PUT just
// reorders existing entries. Persisted globally (not per-profile)
// because the sidebar shows sessions across all profiles. See #1169.

// Caps on the inbound body. The order list is one entry per workspace
// row and workspaces map 1:1 to sessions in the worst case, so 4096 is
// comfortably above any realistic ceiling. Per-entry cap covers a
// long repo path plus a long branch name; ids longer than this can't
// come from the client's workspace id derivation in any sane setup.
